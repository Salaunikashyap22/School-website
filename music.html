                <h2>Why is Music Education Important in Schools?</h2>
                <img src="image1/music1.png" alt=""><br><br>
                Several studies done over the years by educationists and neurophysiologists have shown that music has a
                big influence on the cognitive and psychophysical development of humans—especially children.

                It is believed that when children are exposed to music, especially when they are toddlers or even before
                they are born, it has a deep impact on their cerebral cortex region. It creates neuron pathways in the
                brain making them understand the world and language in a faster and easier.


                Imagine if just listening to music has such a deep impact, how much impact will be playing musical
                instruments have on a student? There are several benefits that a student can get when they learn music
                at school.

                Music is an extremely critical subject at schools as it leads to better brain development, increases
                human connection, improves grades, helps to socialise, and even lowers stress levels.

                <h4><b>.</b>Benefits of Music Education In Schools
                </h4>
                Music classes are a great way to break class monotony. It helps students to unwind and get a break from
                their classes.
                <h4><b>.</b>Fastens Language Development</h4>
                School music classes help improve and spur language development because music is closely related to our
                everyday speech and conversation. The part of the brain that supports language and learning also
                supports music, so one can make a connection as to why music, learning, and languages are closely
                aligned. Music also helps students to develop good reading skills.

                    <b>.</b>Helps to Remove Stress
                </h4>
                Students are just like us. They can get stressed due to many factors like competition among students to
                stay top in the class, fluctuating grades or preparations for exams. This can be both emotionally and
                physically draining. Music classes at schools can help them reduce stress and depression, thus
                preventing physical health issues. Music classes in schools help students relax by synchronising with
                the beats and this way they are able to concentrate on subjects.
                It’s said that music and mathematics go hand in hand. Music education helps to develop cognitive
                abilities and students that are good in music are good at solving mathematical problems like algebra and
                geometry. Researchers believe that the part of the brain that stimulates music is also responsible for
                problem-solving and working on solutions.<h4><b>.</b>Helps With Better Problem Solving</h4>
                <h4><b>.Promotes Creative Thinking</b></h4><br>
                <img src="image1/music4.jpg" alt=""><br><br>
                All top musical bands in the world have one thing in common: they all met in schools or universities,
                found they had common interests and formed musical acts. That’s the power of music. It promotes creative
                thinking among students.it’s interesting and uplifting for students. not only does it help them become
                innovative but it also helps them innovate in the science and technology field. They are also able to
                find solutions to everyday problems—both personally and professionally.
                <h4><b>.</b>Career</h4>
                Music makes for a wonderful career choice today. Take a look around all top musicians or musical acts
                and you will know they all started young. There are many instances of people having picked up their
                first music lessons in schools and have moved on from there. So, yes, learning music in schools really
                does wonder for making a career in music.
                Drumming is one of the best music activities for kids and can be performed by children as young as 4
                years old. It helps to develop their gross motor skills, increase concentration, help with
                self-expression and teach them about rhythm.
                Another popular music activity for kids, which enhances the ability to follow rhythm, movement and
                coordination. It also helps create self-expression through creative movements and activities.<br><br>
                <h4><b>.Conclusion</b></h4>
                It’s important to know that music both inexpensive and fun. It also has mental and therapeutic benefits
                for students. It’s because of these attributes that makes appeaing to students as well as parents. The
                more we talk about music, the more benefits we learn.

                It’s without a doubt to say that music has been integral to communities and civilisations from time
                immemorial. All praises, whether to god or to nature or even to humanity, have been musically written
                which shows how much importance has been ascribed to music.

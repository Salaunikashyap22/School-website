                <h3>Independence day:-</h3>
                Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the
                nation's independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the
                Indian Independence Act, which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly,
                came into effect. India retained King George
                its transition to a republic,
                when the Constitution of India came into effect on 26 January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day)
                and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the enactment of the sovereign law
                Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence movement noted for largely
                non-violent resistance and civil disobedience.

                Independence coincided with the partition of India, in which British India was divided along religious
                lines into the Dominions of India and mass
                casualties.

                <h3>Republic Day:-</h3>
                Republic Day is one of three Indian national holidays and it commemorates the enactment of the
                constitution of India, which occurred on January 26, 1950. India had achieved independence from Britain
                on August 15, 1947 (which is celebrated as a separate national holiday), but for its first three years
                the country remained governed largely by the colonial Government of India Act of 1935.

                Shortly after independence was declared, a constituent assembly elected by provincial assemblies went
                about drafting a constitution that would govern the newly independent nation. After more than two years,
                the constitution of India was completed and solidified the establishment of India’s independent
                democratic government.

                <h3>Seminars and Workshops :-</h3>
                Most of the young graduates lack the confidence and fluency while interacting verbally. Coming either
                from rural or sub-urban background, many students hold good academic record and industrial skills but
                lack behind while expressing themselves. This small yet major drawback often hinders the achievements of
                students while campus placements. Speaking about a researched topic in seminars and workshops before a
                gathered audience boosts the confidence of the students preparing them precisely for interviews and
                group discussions.

                <h3>Kindergarten Parents Talent Competition:-</h3>
                Parents often make sacrifices to their own lives to ensure that they give the best to the children. This
                sometimes means not having as much “fun” as they used to when they were young.

                GIIS KL Kindergarten honoured our KG parents and gave them a chance to go back and have some fun as how
                they did in their younger days.

                A FUN filled Talent Show was organized for parents to participate in conjunction with Mothers and
                Fathers Day. Nine couples participated in the competition; six couples danced, two sang and one couple
                went up the stage to do a stand-up comedy. It was amazing to see how the parents have whole heartedly
                performed on the stage. The few hours together at the Show transported them back to their younger days.
                There were lots of laughter and love all around..

                <h3>World Environment Day:-</h3>
                World Environment Day is celebrated annually on 5 June and encourages awareness and action for the
                protection of the environment. It is supported by many non-governmental organizations, businesses,
                government entities, and represents the primary United Nations outreach day supporting the environment.
                World Environment Day was established in 1972 by the United Nations at the Stockholm Conference on the
                Human Environment (5–16 June 1972), that had resulted from discussions on the integration of human
                interactions and the environment.

                <h3>Annual Function Of School:-</h3>
                The annual function of the school is one the most awaited events for the students during their school
                life.

                Every child, teachers, and even parents of the students wait for the annual function of the school.
                Everyone gets to enjoy, celebrate, and have fun together. Annual Day is an important element of every
                school’s calendar. It is a time of celebration, felicitation, feasting, and festivity when students not
                only present their outstanding performances but also earn awards for their academic and co-curricular
                achievements.

                It is that time of the year when students of all age groups combine, show their talents, and perform
                enthusiastically. The annual functions usually include various activities by the students, insightful
                speeches and lectures by people with valuable experience, competitions, food fests.

                <h3>Teachers activity:-</h3>
                Interactive teaching is all about instructing the students in a way they are actively involved with
                their learning process. There are different ways to create an involvement like this. Most of the time
                it’s through

                teacher-student interaction
                student-student interaction
                the use of audio, visuals, video
                hands-on demonstrations and exercises
                You encourage your students to be active members of your class, thinking on their own, using their
                brains, resulting in long-term memory retention. Not only the students’ knowledge will improve, but
                their interest, strength, knowledge, team spirit and freedom of expression will increase as well.

                <h3>Independence dress children:-</h3>
                Flag hoisting ceremonies and cultural programmes take place in governmental and non-governmental
                institutions throughout the country.[30] Schools and colleges conduct flag hoisting ceremonies and
                various cultural events. Governmental and non-governmental institutions decorate their premises with
                paper, balloon decorations with hangings of freedom fighter portraits on their walls and major
                government buildings are often adorned with strings of lights.[31] In Delhi and some other cities, kite
                flying adds to the occasion.[32][33] National flags of different sizes are used abundantly to symbolise
                allegiance to the country.[34] Citizens adorn their clothing, wristbands, cars, household accessories
                with replicas of the tri-colour.[34] Over a period of time, the celebration has changed emphasis from
                nationalism to a broader celebration of all things India.

                    Common Elements of School Health Services</h3>
                <img src="image1/medical1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt=""><br><br>
                Although a universally accepted definition of the term ''school health services" has not been adopted,
                the School Health Policies and Programs Study (SHPPS) has described school health services as a
                "coordinated system that ensures a continuum of care from school to home to community health care
                provider and back" (Small et al., 1995). The goals and program elements of school health services vary
                at the state, community, school district, and individual school levels. Some of the factors that
                contribute to these variations include student needs, community resources for health care, available
                funding, local preference, leadership for providers of school health services, and the view of health
                services held by school administrators and other key decisionmakers in the school systems.

                <h4><b>.</b>Relative Frequency of Health Problems in Low-Income Children Compared with Other Children
                </h4>


                It is estimated that as many as 12 million children under the age of 18 have no health insurance, or
                approximately 17 percent of all children in that population (American Medical Association Council on
                Scientific Affairs, 1990). Millions more have inadequate plans that fail to cover even basic preventive
                services, such as immunizations (National Health Education Consortium, 1992). Although progress has been
                made in establishing publicly financed community health centers in inner cities and rural areas,
                school-age youth rarely visit these facilities until their health problems reach crisis stage. Although
                Medicaid is intended to provide services for poor children, variations in state Medicaid policies have
                left almost 40 percent of children who live in poverty without access to basic primary and preventive
                care (Solloway and Budetti, 1995). Possible changes in the system imply even greater uncertainty about
                the role Medicaid will play in providing universal coverage for poor children and adolescents

                    <b>.</b>Helps to Remove Stress
                </h4>
                Countless studies have shown that health and academics go hand in hand. To ensure resilient emotional
                and physical health of the students we have incorporated the Health Set Go program. Health Set Go is
                India's pioneering health solutions program working on the World Health Organization School Health
                Framework, with the aim to provide children with a healthy environment which leads to holistic
                development.


                The convenience of living on campus means you have everything you may ever need close by, including
                health services when youâ€™re not feeling well.

                Students have access to the school Hospital, where staff provide on-campus medical assistance and
                educate and counsel students about healthy lifestyle choices. A nurse is on duty or on call at all times
                in the school reception area. The hospital is equipped with beds for comfortable overnight stays.

                MIS also has excellent access to specialist doctors, physiotherapists and other medical experts from
                Mussoorie.

                <h1>500+ Words Essay on My School</h1>
                Education is an essential part of our lives. We are nothing without knowledge, and education is what
                separates us from others. The main step to acquiring education is enrolling oneself in a school.
                School serves as the first learning place for most of the people. Similarly, it is the first spark
                in receiving an education. In this essay on my school, I will tell you why I love my school and what
                my school has taught me.<br><br><br>

                    My school is my second home where I spend most of my time. Above all, it gives me a platform to do
                    better in life and also builds my personality. I feel blessed to study in one of the most
                    prestigious and esteemed schools in the city. In addition, my school has a lot of assets which makes
                    me feel fortunate to be a part of it. Let us look at the essay on my school written
                    below.

                    We have all been to school and we have loved each and every moment we have spent over there as those
                    were the building blocks of our lives. A school is a place where students are taught the
                    fundamentals of life, as well as how to grow and survive in life. It instils in us values and
                    principles that serve as the foundation for a child’s development.

                    From kindergarten through primary and secondary school, and subsequently, to faculty, school is a
                    place where we always study, grow, and establish ourselves, socialize, be a friend, help others, and
                    love and be loved. School is a buddy that will accompany us from the beginning of our youth till the
                    conclusion of our lives. At school, we share all of our pleasures and sorrows, and we constantly
                    rely on one another. This is made possible through the friendships we share. <br><br><br>

                    My school strikes the perfect balance between modern education and vintage architecture. The vintage
                    buildings of my school never fail to mesmerize me with their glorious beauty. However, their vintage
                    architecture does not mean it is outdated, as it is well-equipped with all the contemporary gadgets.
                    I see my school as a lighthouse of education bestowing knowledge as well as ethical conduct upon us.<br><br><br>

                    Teachers have the power to make or break a school. The teaching staff is regarded as the foundation
                    of any educational society. It is their efforts to help kids learn and understand things that instil
                    good habits and values in their students. While some concepts are simple to grasp, others
                    necessitate the use of a skilled teacher to drive the home the idea with each pupil.<br><br><br>

                    <h3>What has My School Taught Me?</h3>
                    If someone asked me what I have learned from my school, I won’t be able to answer it in one
                    sentence. For the lessons are irreplaceable and I can never be thankful enough for them. I learned
                    to share because of my school. The power of sharing and sympathy was taught to me by my school. I
                    learned how to be considerate towards animals and it is also one of the main reasons why I adopted a
                    pet.<br><br><br>

                    School is an excellent place to learn how to be an adult before entering the real world. Those
                    abilities pay dividends whether you choose to be the bigger person in an argument or simply complete
                    your domestic tasks. When you open your mind to new ideas, you gain a lot of influence in society.
                    Picking up unexpected hobbies on your own will teach you more about what you like to do than simply
                    completing things for a grade.<br><br><br>

                    A school is a place where I developed my artistic skills which were further enhanced by my teachers.
                    Subsequently, it led me to participate in inter-school completions through which I earned various
                    awards. Most importantly, my school taught me how to face failures with grace and never give up on
                    my ambitions, no matter what happens.<br><br><br>

                    Schools also offer a variety of extracurricular activities such as Scouts and Guides, sports,
                    N.C.C., skating, school band, acting, dancing, singing, and so on. Our principal also used to give
                    us a short lecture every day for about 10 minutes about etiquette, character development, moral
                    education, respecting others, and gaining excellent values. As a result, I can claim that what I am
                    today is solely due to my school, which is the best institution in my opinion.<br><br><br>

                    Teamwork is an important ability that schools teach. Schools are frequently the first places where
                    youngsters have the opportunity to collaborate with children who are different from them.
                    Collaboration is essential for the team and individual success. Students are taught that the success
                    of a team depends on each individual component functioning together.<br><br><br>

                    <h3>Q.1 Why must every child go to school?</h3>

                    A.1 It is essential for every child to go to school as the school teaches us lessons that cannot be
                    acquired anywhere else. The experience is one a kind and along with education, we learn many other
                    things like socializing, extra-curricular activities and more.<br><br><br>

                    A.2 School teaches us some of the great things like first of all, it gives us basic education. It
                    teaches us to develop our skills like art, dance, public speaking and more. Most importantly, it
                    teaches us discipline.
